The Car Parking App is an innovative and user-centric mobile application developed to simplify and enhance the parking experience for users and parking lot operators. Created by Hashem Aljdaani, Majed Almutairy, Fahad Alamuodi, Saad Almutairy, and Muhannad Althagafi, this application leverages modern technologies like Firebase Realtime Database, Firebase Authentication, and QR code systems to offer seamless parking reservations, real-time updates, and efficient parking lot access.

Purpose
The app is designed to solve the common challenges associated with parking, such as the lack of available spaces, long wait times at entry points, and inefficient payment methods. With features tailored for ease of use, security, and automation, the Car Parking App brings a cutting-edge solution to urban mobility and parking management.
